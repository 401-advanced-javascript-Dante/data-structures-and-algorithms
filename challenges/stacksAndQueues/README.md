# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
create a node class 

create a Stack class
with: push(), pop(), isEmpty() and peek() ;

create a Queue class 
with: enqueue(), dequeue(), isEmpty() and peek() ;


## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- i need to create three classes for node , stack and queue .
so in stack i can push , pop and in the queue to enqueue and dequeue .

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- in stake we know that firs in last out , by using a top pointer that updated every time we can push or pop by using it ,on the other side in queue i used two pointers front and back , so when i need to add i just change the back pointer and when i want to remove i change the front pointer 
## Big O notation 
we used to have O(n) and O(n^2) when we want to add or remove from linked-list but here with the pointers it much easier , no need to go through the all nodes every time we want to do something and less complexity so here O(1) ;

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
create a node class 
create linked list class 
insert and search through the linked-list
adding append() , insertBefore() , insertAfter() functions .


## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
i need to create a linked list by using two classes one for the node and other for linked list , i need to have a function to add nodes to the list and another one to search through it nodes for a value to check if it exist or not , 
then adding append() , insertBefore() , insertAfter() functions  to add values to the end of the link or to specific location in the list .

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
i create a class for the linked list have a constructor function and functions to add node and check the nodes for specific value and return true or false depend on that , also create a test for each feature of the challenge .

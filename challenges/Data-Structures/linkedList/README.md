# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
create a node class 
create linked list class 
insert and search through the linked-list
adding append() , insertBefore() , insertAfter() functions .
adding kthFromEnd() ;


## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- i need to create a linked list by using two classes one for the node and other for linked list , i need to have a function to add nodes to the list and another one to search through it nodes for a value to check if it exist or not , 
- then adding append() , insertBefore() , insertAfter() functions  to add values to the end of the link or to specific location in the list .
- adding adding kthFromEnd() that take number of the index > 0 as an input and return the value of the node exist at input , knowing that we start countering from the tail of the linked-list 


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- i create a class for the linked list have a constructor function and functions to add node and check the nodes for specific value and return true or false depend on that , also create a test for each feature of the challenge .

- adding new functions that help to add , update and find values of nodes .

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- creating a class named AnimalShelter have a two methods one for enqueue and the other for dequeue , we enqueue and dequeue objects if dogs or cat .  

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
i create class have front and back properties also have two methods one for enqueue and the other one for dequeue , when i enqueue an object i use the back property then set it at the new object , when i dequeue i change the front property to the next object thats it . . .
first in first out ..


## Big O notation 
here we have two methods for enqueue we just use the back property and set it next to the new object so O(1), for dequeue we just change the front to it next object and thats it so O(1) .

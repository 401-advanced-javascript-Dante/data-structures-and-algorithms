# Challenge Summary
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
create a node class 
create linked list class 
adding mergeLists() function 

## Challenge Description
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- i need to create a function takes 2 linked lists and merge them .

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- i create the function that take 2 inputs an return new linked list have the two lists that i input , by using the constructor function as the new linked-list and add the two lists with the right sequence ;

## Solution

## Big O notation 
i used the class constructor to merge the two lists together by going throw them once , so we can say O(n) for them , but i used insert() to add the values so every time i add a new one i need to start from the begaining of the new list , so here O(2n) , so we can say the big O in this challenge gonna be O(2n) .
